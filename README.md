# Pong-retro-basic
 This is the most basic version of the retro game pong or also well known as ping pong. The left paddle is  the player's paddle i.e. you and the right paddle is the Computer's paddle which has been instructed by the code to follow movements of the ball and hit it back. A small scale use of somewhat AI has been implemented here in the working of the computer paddle. Have fun playing!
